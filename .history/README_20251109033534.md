You choose one exit of the other. One either sends you home or you die 3:1 and the other either sends you to another room, or generates a new room for you. Each room is described by ai and one image. Once the room is created, it has two exits too. Always the same math. 3:1 home or death in one or a new room or existing room in the other.
